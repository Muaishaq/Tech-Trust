TechTrust MVP: Secure Transaction Verification System

1. Project Overview

TechTrust MVP (Minimum Viable Product) is a proof-of-concept for a secure, real-time transaction verification platform designed to mitigate financial fraud by calculating a composite risk score. The system's primary goal is to provide instantaneous validation for user transactions using a combination of behavioral data analysis, database integrity checks, and a proprietary artificial intelligence engine.

This project was executed as a rapid 15-day sprint by a three-person development team (M1, M2, M3) focused on demonstrating core functionality, scalability, and integration efficiency.

2. Problem Statement

Traditional transaction verification methods often rely on simple static rules (e.g., spending limits or known fraud lists), which are easily bypassed by sophisticated modern fraud techniques. This leads to high rates of both false positives (blocking legitimate transactions) and false negatives (allowing fraudulent transactions). The need is for a dynamic, multi-factor verification system that adapts to complex user behavior patterns in real-time.

3. Solution: Composite Risk Scoring

TechTrust addresses this problem by implementing a composite risk scoring mechanism across three distinct technical layers:

Behavioral Score (M2): Calculated by the backend against recent user activities, such as transaction frequency, amount volatility, and geographic history.

Integrity Score (M2): Checks for data consistency and authentication validity (e.g., successful token verification, database record integrity).

AI Verification Score (M3): A core component provided by the Proprietary AI Engine, which processes the enriched transaction data to generate a machine-learned risk score (0-100), predicting the probability of the transaction being malicious.

The final verification status (PASS/FAIL) is determined by a threshold applied to the AI-generated risk score.

4. Technical Architecture and Modules

The system follows a microservice-oriented approach, dividing responsibilities among three specialized modules:

M1: Frontend & UX Specialist

Role: Develops the responsive, user-friendly client-side interface.

Technologies: HTML, Tailwind CSS, Vanilla JavaScript.

Responsibilities: Client-side validation, state management, and clear display of transaction results and risk scores.

M2: Backend & Database Specialist

Role: Manages the core business logic, API endpoints, and data persistence.

Technologies: RESTful API (Node.js/Express mock), PostgreSQL (for Users and Transactions data).

Responsibilities: User authentication, data enrichment (combining transaction input with historical data), and acting as the central broker between the Frontend (M1) and the AI Engine (M3).

M3: AI & Verification Engineer

Role: Designs and deploys the Machine Learning (ML) verification service.

Technologies: Proprietary AI Engine/ML Framework SDK, dedicated REST API service.

Responsibilities: Real-time risk score calculation, ensuring high availability, and maintaining the core verification logic.

5. Key Integrations and Data Flow

The success of the MVP relies on a clear, sequential data flow:

Initiation: M1 sends a secure transaction request (with user credentials) to M2.

Enrichment: M2 authenticates the user and fetches relevant behavioral data from the database.

Verification: M2 calls the M3 REST API, passing the enriched data payload.

Scoring: M3's Proprietary AI Engine calculates and returns the riskScore (0-100) and verificationStatus ('PASS'/'FAIL') to M2.

Finalization: M2 persists the complete transaction record (including the M3 score) in the database and sends the final status back to M1.

Presentation: M1 displays the final result to the user.

6. Deliverables and Outcome

The 15-day sprint resulted in a fully functional, end-to-end prototype demonstrating:

Secure User Flow: A robust login and transaction submission process.

API Brokerage: Successful integration between the M2 core API and the external M3 verification service.

Database Schema: A defined and utilized PostgreSQL schema for users and transaction records.

Real-time Scoring: The ability to generate and display a predictive risk score for any given transaction in real time.

Roadmap: A clear, filterable roadmap detailing task ownership and project velocity.

This MVP confirms the feasibility of integrating advanced AI/ML verification into a traditional backend stack, providing a strong foundation for future scaled development.
